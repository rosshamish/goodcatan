##### Brief introduction to the topic
[prop-intro]: #brief-introduction-to-the-topic

I’m interested in applying machine learning techniques to generate intelligent actors in domains with imperfect information. I’d like to build upon what I’ve learned from both ECE 449 Intelligent Systems Engineering and CMPUT 466 Machine Learning. The domain I’d like to do the research in is in multiplayer board games, specifically in Settlers of Catan. It is a four-player board game with imperfect information, which makes it a good candidate for this research.

I’m interested in exploring Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) as initial candidate approaches. HMMs effectively describe sequences containing hidden state. RNNs effectively deal with time-series sequences where previous actions influence future actions. In the case of Catan, a sequence contains actions carried out by each player on their turn.

I’ve carried out a first-pass [literature review](#literature-review). This literature review will serve as a reading list for the course. This list will expand as the project progresses. A sample is listed here.

A Tutorial on Hidden Markov Models and Selected Application in Speech Recognition ([Rabiner, 1989])
The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks ([Karpathy, 2015])
Monte-Carlo Tree Search: A New Framework for Game AI ([Chaslot et al, 2008])
Reinforcement Learning of Strategies for Settlers of Catan ([Pfeiffer, 2004])

Additionally, a [GPLv3 licensed implementation of Settlers of Catan][lit-catan-sw] exists, and can be used as a testbed.
